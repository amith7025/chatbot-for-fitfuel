## Overview

The FitFuel Chatbot is a project designed to provide answers to a wide range of medical questions, supporting the FitFuel initiative. With responses spanning over 1940 medical topics, this chatbot serves as a valuable resource for health-related inquiries.

## Transformer Architecture

Built on the revolutionary Transformer architecture, the FitFuel Chatbot represents the forefront of natural language processing. The Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), has become the backbone of modern language models. Its key features include:

- **Attention Mechanism:** Allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, capturing long-range dependencies effectively.

- **Multi-Head Attention:** Enabling the model to attend to different positions with different learned linear projections, providing enhanced representational power.

- **Positional Encoding:** Incorporating the position of words in the input sequence, addressing the lack of sequential information in the original Transformer model.

- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** Processing the information from the attention mechanism, facilitating the learning of complex relationships.


## Repository Structure

- **code:** This directory contains the source code for the FitFuel Chatbot. To run the chatbot, navigate to the 'code' folder and follow the instructions in the README within that directory.

- **models:** The 'models' directory holds the trained models used by the chatbot. These models are crucial for generating accurate responses.

- **data:** Inside the 'data' folder, you'll find the dataset used for training the chatbot. Understanding the data can provide insights into the chatbot's knowledge base.

- **notebooks:** The 'notebooks' directory includes Jupyter notebooks used during the development or for any analysis related to the FitFuel Chatbot.

- **requirements.txt:** This file lists all the Python modules and dependencies required to run the FitFuel Chatbot. Install these dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
